<sect>Introduction

<p> 
KZip is a program for managing and quickly extracting archives. It works
closely with KFM and various other parts of the KDE environment. Current
features include, a quick list of archives in a user defined directory,
quick extraction of archives to any directory, and adding files via drag and
drop from kfm.

<sect>Installation 
<p> 
<sect1>How to obtain KZip 

<p> KZip can be found in the kdeutils package of the K Desktop Environment
<url url="http://www.kde.org">. <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/"> is
the main ftp site of the KDE project.

<sect1>Requirements
<p>
<itemize>
<item>The latest version of KDE. KDE is in beta so not everything will work
perfectly. It can be found on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/">.
<item>GNU Tar v1.12 and a recent gzip.
<item>KFM is needed to get full functionality from KZip.
<item>Qt v1.31.  Information regarding Qt can found on 
<url url="http://www.troll.no/">.
<item>The appropriate programs for other archive formats are needed as well. 
These include lha, zip, unzip, and ar.
</itemize>

<sect>Onscreen Fundamentals
<p>
<sect1> Setting the Archive Directory 
<p>
KZip will automatically remember your archive dir. You must first set it via
"Set Archive Directory" from the options menu. Enter the full path, such as,
"/home/rob/dloads". To quickly go to this directory when kzip is running,
click on the home icon on the toolbar. A listing of all files in the archive
directory will then be shown. Double-click on an archive to open it.

<sect1>Opening and Viewing Archives
<p>
 There are a few different ways to open an archive. The first is done by
clicking on either the open button on the toolbar or by choosing open from
the file menu. The second is done by double-clicking on an archive in your
archive directory.

<sect1>Working with Files
<p>
An archive must be opened before any work can be done with it. To view a
file in an archive double click on it or select view from the edit menu
after selecting a file. A dialog will come up asking for the program you
wish to view it with. Type in kless, kview, or whatever is appropriate for
that file.  Select "Edit...Extract" in the menus to extract the selected
file to a directory of your choice.  Select "Edit...Delete" to remove the
selected file from the archive.

<sect1>Extracting Archives
<p>

Once you have opened an archive it can be quickly extracted to any directory.
To do this either click on the extract button on the toolbar or choose
"Extract To" from the file menu. A dialog will come up asking you for the
destination directory. Type in the full path, such as, "/home/rob/new_kde_stuff".
A progress indicator will popup showing just that, and disappear when finished.

<sect1>Creating and Adding Files to Archives
<p>
To create a new archive choose new from the file menu. Files can be added
to an open archive by dragging them in from KFM. Whole directories and
multiple files can dropped on KZip at once.

<sect2>File adding options...
<p>
This pops up a dialog with two checboxes.  If you want files added to
archives to be stored from there full path, for instance /bin/sh, check this. 
Otherwise they will be stored from the directory they are dragged out of in
KFM.  
<p>
